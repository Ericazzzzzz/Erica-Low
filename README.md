## üíº Projects

### [Mile End Deceptive Storytelling Detection (Python)](https://github.com/Ericazzzzzz/Mile-End-Deceptive-Storytelling-Detection)
*Nov 2024 -Dec 2024*
- Designed and deployed a full machine learning pipeline using real-world audio data from MLEnd, covering preprocessing, feature extraction, and model evaluation.
- Engineered audio features (e.g., pitch mean, spectral contrast) using Librosa and trained classifiers including Logistic Regression, SVM, and XGBoost, achieving a highest F1 score of 0.42.
- Analyzed nuanced classification challenges with confusion matrix insights, highlighting areas for improvement and future exploration.
  

### [Storks Deliver Babies (Python)](https://github.com/Ericazzzzzz/Storks-Deliver-Babies)
*Nov 2024*
- Improved model accuracy by 20% when shifting from a simple stork-birth correlation model to a multivariate model using population size, GDP per capita, and population density as predictors.
- Validated model reliability through bootstrapping, demonstrating the limitations of spurious correlations and emphasizing robust model selection for accurate insights.


### [UK Property Price Trends (Python)](https://github.com/Ericazzzzzz/UK-Property-Prices-Trend)
*Nov 2024*
- Analyzed 12 months of data from a 36 months property price data across various UK regions, uncovering trends and regional disparities, such as up to 8% declines in certain London areas and up to 6% increases in the West Midlands and North West.
- Created visualizations to clearly present regional price differences, supporting data-driven decision-making for stakeholders and highlighting areas of potential investment interest.

### [Texas Bridges Condition Analysis (Python)](https://github.com/Ericazzzzzz/Texas-Bridges-Condition-Analysis)
*Oct 2024*
- Built and optimized regression models for predicting bridge conditions, enhancing explanatory power by 10% with adding predictors (material and design). 
- Identified age as the most influential factor, decreasing condition scores by 62.9%, and highlighted material also as a key predictor, aiding future infrastructure maintenance.

### [Demographic of LSOA in England (Python)](https://github.com/Ericazzzzzz/Demographics-of-LSOA-in-England)
*Sept 2024*  
- Identified key patterns in population distribution that varied across urban and rural areas.
- Provided a classification system to aid in demographic studies and urban planning.

### [Pygame Snake Game (Python)](https://github.com/Ericazzzzzz/Snake-and-Apple-Game)
*July 2024*
- Developed a fully functional 2D snake game using Pygame, implementing user control, collision detection, scoring system and game-over logic, resulting in a dynamic and interactive gameplay experience. 


### [Real Estate Price Prediction Website (Python, Scikit-learn, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AWS EC2, Nginx)](https://github.com/Ericazzzzzz/Real-Estate-Price-Prediction)
*June 2024*  
- Built a predictive model using Scikit-Learn for real estate price prediction.
- Developed a Flask web app with a responsive front-end to provide real-time predictions based on user inputs.
- Deployed the application on AWS EC2 using Nginx for efficient web hosting and Python Flask for handling HTTP requests.


### [Predictive Modelling for Agriculture (Python)]
*February 2024*  
- Developed a multi-class classification model to predict crop types, avoiding multicollinearity.
- Evaluated model performance using cross-validation and visualization.

### [Bank Marketing Database (SQL)]
*October 2023*  
- Cleaned data and designed a PostgreSQL database to store information about marketing campaigns run by a bank.
- Utilized SQL queries to analyze customer data and improve marketing strategy.

### [Discovery of Handwash (Python)]
*September 2023*  
- Built a data frame to analyze raw data of population death rates at clinics before handwash obligations.
- Visualized data using Matplotlib and conducted Bootstrap analysis to assess the impact of handwashing on mortality rates.

### [Bioinformatics Project (R)]
*December 2022*  
- Analyzed and compared real-life COVID-19 data with other viral infections to determine affected signalling pathways.
- Created PCA, volcano plots, and pheatmaps for comprehensive data visualization.
